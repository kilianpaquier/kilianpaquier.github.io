description: Passionate about computer science since the last two years of secondary school, I pursued a path towards an integrated preparatory class at Polytech Tours after graduating from high school. I completed my studies in 2021, after a year in a double degree program with the University of Quebec in Chicoutimi (UQAC). In my free time, I enjoy working on small projects, watching animes/tv shows as well as reading manga/manhwa online.
