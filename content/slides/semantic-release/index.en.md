##### What could it be ?

- Open Source product to handle git versioning
- Create releases from commits
- Developped with javascript
- Working with 9 execution steps
- Expandable with a plugin system
- Customizable with the CLI (Command Line Interface)
- Customizable with a file (`.releaserc` with `.yaml`, `.json` or `.js` formats)

---

##### Semantic Versioning

Also named [semver](https://semver.org/), it is a specification for version naming.
Complete specification [here](https://semver.org/#backusnaur-form-grammar-for-valid-semver-versions) but some examples:

- `1.0.0`
- `12.16.1788`
- `1.0.0-beta.1`
- `1.0.0+702c7fcc879cf8cd0401e70fc083386e07ff0a35`
- `1.0.0+702c7fcc879`
- `1.0.0-dev.702c7fcc879`

It's common to add a "v" prefix to git tags and versions, that is in part why **semantic-release** offer a customization property for that.

##### Execution steps

- Verify Conditions:
  - Verification of certain conditions (like access tokens for instance)
- Get last release:
  - Collect of previous release commits and version number
- Analyze commits:
  - Next release computing (prelease, patch, minor, major, next, etc.)
- Verify release:
  - Free step for plugins to ensure that the release to be made is "compliant"

---

- Generate notes: Release notes generation
  - Appear in release page (depending on whether this notion exists in git platform)
  - Appear in `CHANGELOG.md` file
- Create git tag: Git tag creation
- Prepare: Release preparation
  - Free step for plugins to prepare for *publish* step
- Publish: Release publishing
- Notify: Release success or failure notification

##### Customization

- `--extends`
- `--branches`
- `--tagFormat`
- `--plugins`
- `--repositoryUrl`
- `--dry-run`
- `--ci` / `--no-ci`
- `--debug`

---

##### Branches

Handles globs with [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch?tab=readme-ov-file#matching-features)

```yaml
branches:
  # 1.12.x, 1.x
  - +([0-9])?(.{+([0-9]),x}).x
  - master
  - main
  - next
  - next-major
  # branch named "beta" is categorized as prerelease
  # resulting tag would be 1.12.5-beta.X
  - { name: "beta", prerelease: true }
  # branch named "staging" is categorized as prerelease
  # resulting tag would be 1.12.5-beta.X
  - { name: "staging", prerelease: "beta" }
```
