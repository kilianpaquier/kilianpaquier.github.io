{{< center "Launching blog ! Find all my technology monitoring discovery." >}}

ðŸ‘‰ Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) because I wanted a lightweight project. As I've been testing different technologies for my website (Vuejs, Angular, pure HTML) for several years, Hugo is a natural choice in line with my latest experience with Golang.

ðŸ‘‰ There are quite a few optimizations to make it load quickly, but that's a good challenge!

ðŸ‘‰ Plus, writing in Markdown and having it rendered in HTML is so simple, no need to bother writing everything in unreadable HTML code!

ðŸ‘‰ And it's quick to compile, easy to understand, and there's no unnecessary generation of JavaScript or CSS.

ðŸ‘‰ I drew a lot of inspiration from the visual style offered by [Doks]((https://doks.netlify.app/)). In fact, I wanted to use their Hugo theme, but the Node.js addons (despite being relevant) did not align with my goals. Plus, I prefer the small menu in the bottom-right corner that adapts well to the *responsive* mode of small screens.
